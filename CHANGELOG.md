## What's new in v2.0.0-beta.5

This update adds the option to select an existing mod to update when installing a mod (through file/folder selection, drag and drop, or mod manager download from NexusMods).
It also improves the performance of the file tree picker, so installing mods with a ton of files should be smoother.

On Windows, users should no longer see a console window popup when extracting archives (e.g. while installing mods).
Also, Linux users using [AppManager](https://github.com/kem-a/AppManager) should now be able to install the AppImage without error messages.

- Added: Option to update an existing mod in the installing mod dialog
- Improved: Order files alphabetically in the file selector tree in the installing mod dialog
- Improved: Performance in the file selector tree in the installing mod dialog
- Improved: Readme / text file buttons have proper gaps and maximum height in the installing mod dialog
- Fixed: Console window spawning on Windows when creating/extracting archives
- Fixed: Broken .DirIcon symlink in AppImage on Linux (upstream fix: [tauri-apps/tauri#15110](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/15110))
- Misc: Updated Cargo and npm dependencies

## What's new in v2.0.0-beta.4

This update should fix issues with extracting RAR archives:

- Updated: Bundling 7z instead of 7za for UnRAR support on Windows.
- Added: More helpful error message if RAR archives cannot be extracted.
- Added: Fallback to WinRAR to extract RAR archives if it is installed and 7-Zip doesn't support RAR extraction.
- Fixed: If Windows was installed on a different drive than `C:`, then Steam should be found now.

## What's new in v2.0.0-beta.3

This update adds new game settings, automatic translation downloads and some smaller bug fixes:

- Added: New game settings (throwing arc, item scrap prompts, locked item use, map region names)
- Added: Automatic download of translations on app start (opt-out)
- Added: Button to show custom resolution picker
- Fixed: Show that deployment is necessary when reordering mods
- Fixed: Create the `languages` folder when opening the translation folder from the app instead of displaying an error
- Fixed: Prevent a possible race condition when saving profiles and settings which might have caused corruption / data loss
- Fixed: Disable autocomplete suggestions on input fields
- Fixed: Empty mods path was not set when game path was changed in the profile editing dialog in some situations

## What's new in v2.0.0-beta.2

A small bug fix update:

- Added: "Remove game's archives" button in the resource list tab.
- Fixed: Switching the resource list in the mod manager should now switch it in the `Fallout76Custom.ini` file instead of leaving duplicates.
- Fixed: The toast message that an update is available should no longer be shown on start, unless there really is an update.
- Fixed: The resource list tab might not have refreshed the list properly when the number of items didn't change.
